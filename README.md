# Graph Solutions Project

## Overview
This project solves several classic graph-related problems using Python. 
The problems covered include:

1. Depth-First Search (DFS) to check if a path exists between two nodes.
2. Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
3. Detecting cycles in a directed graph using DFS.

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Contains the source code for graph solutions and the test harness.
- `docker/`: Contains Docker-related files for containerizing the application.
- `.gitignore`: Ensures that unnecessary files, such as IDE configurations, are excluded from version control.
- `Dockerfile`: Defines how to build the containerized version of the application.

## Current State
- Solutions for the three graph problems have been implemented.
- A test harness is available to run several test cases, covering edge cases and corner cases.

## Remaining Work
- Implement additional graph algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, topological sorting).
- Create more extensive test cases, particularly for larger graphs.
- Containerize the application using Docker for easier deployment.
- Ensure compatibility with cloud-based platforms like AWS or Azure.
